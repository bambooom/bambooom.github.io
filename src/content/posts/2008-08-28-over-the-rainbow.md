Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high

There's a land that I heard of once in a lullaby

Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue

And the dreams that you dare to dream really do come true

Someday I'll wish upon a star

And wake up where the clouds are far behind me

Where troubles melt like lemon drops

Away above the chimney tops

That's where you'll find me

Somewhere over the rainbow, bluebirds fly

Birds fly over the rainbow

Why then, oh why can't I?


If happy little bluebirds fly

Beyond the rainbow

Why, oh why can't I?

Your happiness is not mine.
but
where is mine?
it says,
the most precious thing exists
at the end of the rainbow.
however
how many people will rush to find it
or just dream about it'll come to u someday?
so
everybody lei it be.
not a good idea?
yes, maybe
not always

if birds can fly over the rainbow,
why can't I?
if u can find ur happiness,
so why can't I?
